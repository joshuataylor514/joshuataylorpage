			_Having worked within the world's largest educational publishers, I understand and am inspired by the complex shifts we're seeing in education, particularly from the user-experience perspectives of both learners and instructors.
		</p>
		<p>
			_I've worked for over 10 years in nearly all areas of content management, development, and operations in both web content and at two of the largest educational publishers in the world. I've also worked in a traditional journalistic capacity as an editor, writer, and content strategist.
		</p>
		<p>
			_I'm adept at managing large volumes of content, tackling complicated editorial schedules, designing systems for scalability, and overseeing content vendors. At my current role, I've created an entirely new company-wide organizational hierarchy to manage all freelance content developers, writers, and vendors. I created guidelines, deliverables, templates, and reporting structure related to all content development and production tasks, while improving the quality and consistency of our content.
		</p>
		<p>
			_I've worked specifically on instructional design, education, and early childhood education products so I'm very experienced in working with state/federal educational standards and taxonomies.
		</p>
		<p>
			_After leading teams on hundreds of large-scale content projects, and too many instructor ancillaries to count, I've developed a keen eye for quality content and outstanding authors.
		</p>
		<p>
			_ I've been recognized by executives as both a creative and analytical thinker, and was named to a prestigious special taskforce to expedite the digital transformation of our organization. We're also tasked with creating standards around metadata tagging, delivery models, and various other areas to ensure our content easily integrates into various digital platforms.
		</p>
 		<p>
			_In my spare time I enjoy cycling, kayaking, live music, craft beer, and playing with my cat.
